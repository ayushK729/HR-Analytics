    "    <p>AtliQ Hardwares is a company specializing in the sales of hardware products, providing services across India. Recently, the company observed a decline in overall productivity, prompting a closer look at employee attendance patterns. During a meeting, irregular trends in employee presence were identified, which led the HR department to investigate further.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Upon reviewing the attendance records, it became apparent that, while the company maintained basic attendance data, there was a lack of in-depth analysis regarding employee work preferences, absenteeism due to illness, and the potential seasonal factors influencing attendance.</p>\n",
    "    <p>To address this, the HR department tasked the Data Analysis team with developing a comprehensive dashboard to better understand these attendance trends. The team was provided with attendance data for AtliQ employees from April 2022 to May 2022 to conduct this analysis.</p>\n",

    "    <p>When attempting to merge all three worksheets into a single file, the column names were corrupted, as the original column names were retained from the previous worksheets. This resulted in a messy dataset that was not suitable for further analysis.</p>\n",
    "    <h5>Solution:</h5>\n",
    "    <p>To address this issue, we designed a template in Power BI to merge the current and future attendance worksheets into a unified data table. The following steps were taken:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Template Creation:</strong> We began by duplicating the table structure to create a new template.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Selecting Base Table:</strong> We selected one table from the three available worksheets (April, May, and June) to serve as the base for the template.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Promoting Column Headers:</strong> The row containing column names was promoted to header status.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Removing Unnecessary Data:</strong> The first row, containing the employee code, was removed as it was irrelevant to the data structure.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Renaming Columns:</strong> We renamed the columns to their proper names to ensure consistency and clarity.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Unpivoting Data:</strong> The employee code and name columns were selected, while the other columns were unpivoted using Power BI’s “Unpivot Column” option to normalize the data.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Function Creation:</strong> A function with parameters based on the template was created to apply this transformation to future data, making it possible to seamlessly arrange new data in a more usable format.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h4>Issue 2: Monthly Leave Statistics Included Post-Pivot</h4>\n",
    "    <p>After performing the pivot operation, the table contained monthly leave statistics, which were not relevant to the transformed data and cluttered the dataset.</p>\n",
    "    <h5>Solution:</h5>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>The data type for the relevant columns was set to “Date”</li>\n",
    "        <li>Errors were removed by right-clicking the column and selecting \"Remove Errors,\" ensuring that any unforeseen data would be easily handled in the future.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h4>Issue 3: Date Entries Displayed as ###### Post-Transformation</h4>\n",
    "    <p>Following the data transformation, the date entries were displayed as \"######\" instead of the expected date format, which indicated a data type issue.</p>\n",
    "    <h5>Solution:</h5>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>The data type of the date column was changed to \"Date\"</li>\n",
    "        <li>A copy of the original date column was created and formatted to display the date in the “MMM YY” format.</li>\n",
    "        <li>The new date column was renamed as “Month” to provide a cleaner, more readable format for the transformed data.</li>\n",
